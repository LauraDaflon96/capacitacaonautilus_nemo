# Projects made during the selective process of Nautilus (UFRJ) #

# Solar system

**How do I run the program?**
First, you need to have on your computer the [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) aplication. After having it, you have to type `roscore` in your prompt to run the Master and then launch the program in another prompt with `roslaunch`. Then, you can run RViz just by typing `rviz` in the prompt.

**What I can do about the solar reference?**
You can change the reference to any planet listed, just by selecting it in the program.

**How the system works?**
As it's just for reference, the values are aproximated and some were adapted to the model.

# Arduino Car
**How to use the code:**
The code is designed to a car formed by Arduino Nano V3 Atmega328, DC motors and Hbridge L298. But you can teste the code in a more broad way going to [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/). After starting, each number will represent an action:

1. Backward-left
2. Backward
3. Backward-right
4. Turn left
5. Stop
6. Turn right
7. Foward-left
8. Foward
9. Foward-right

**How the code works:**
The code control the motors in two of the three wheels that are in the car. With this it can make the car changes it's direction. 

# OpenCv (Nemo)

**How to use the program:**
In the terminal, go to the directory where you downloaded the file and type `python 2 nemo.py`. Than it will display the original video and the video where you can see only the fishes. To exit type `q`. You need to save the file of the video in the Documents section, otherwise, it will require a change in the code.
